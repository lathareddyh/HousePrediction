# HousePrediction
Developed a machine learning model to predict residential house prices in Bangalore based on key features such as location, total square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), bathrooms, and availability. The project involved data cleaning, handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering to improve model accuracy. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand price trends across different localities.

Implemented regression models such as Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge to compare performance and select the best model using evaluation metrics like R² score
